# Speed2App idea

My thoughts from right now: start with native iOS, Objective C,
iPhone-only, store data locally, the one workout routine I’m currently
doing, one gym only (so exactly one set of settings per exercise),
prompt me for the next machine I need to find, tell me the settings and
weights, make it butt-simple to enter the number of reps I just did,
prompt for the next machine, end today’s workout, tell me when my next
workout should be.
